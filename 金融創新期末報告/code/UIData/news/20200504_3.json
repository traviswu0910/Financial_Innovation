The company swung to a net loss of $40.2 million, or 35 cents a share, from net income of $32.3 million, or 31 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, such as the amortization of assets and acquisition-related charges, adjusted earning per share came to 58 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 22 cents. Sales rose 49% to $7.00 billion, primarily because of the acquisitions of Eby-Brown Co. and Reinhart Foodservice, but was below the FactSet consensus of $7.20 billion. Case volume rose 26.4%; excluding Reinhart, independent cases fell 2.7%. Among actions taken as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the company has furloughed 3,500 employees, deferred 25% of senior management's base salaries, discontinues share repurchases, raised $349 million in the equity markets and $275 million in the fixed income markets and drew $400 million from its $3.0 billion credit facility.
