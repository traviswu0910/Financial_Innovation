The stock was little changed in premarket trading. Net income rose to $3.60 billion, or $1.93 a share, from $2.65 billion, or $1.39 a share, in the year-ago period. Sales fell 13.1% to $29.71 billion, while total revenue, which includes income from equity affiliates and other income, declined 10.5% to $31.50 billion. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was 65 cents and for sales was $29.1 billion. Chevron said it was further reducing its 2020 capital expenditure outlook by $2 billion to $14 billion, and expects operating costs to decrease by $1 billion. The company previously announced that it was suspending stock repurchases and has completed additional asset sales. \"Together these actions are consistent with our longstanding financial priorities: to protect the dividend; to prioritize capital that drives long-term value; and to maintain a strong balance sheet,\" said Chief Executive Michael Wirth. The stock has dropped 14.1% over the past three months through Thursday, while crude oil futures  have tumbled 64.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has declined 13.8%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Late Thursday, Amazon said coronavirus-related costs such as employee testing and higher wages added to expenses and would likely in the future. Meanwhile, Apple declined to provide guidance for the current quarter.

company matched profit expectations but topped sales forecasts, and said it was taking further measures to strengthen its financial position amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Net income rose to $258 million, or 32 cents a share, from $208 million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding special items, adjusted EPS fell to 59 cents from 98 cents but matched the FactSet consensus. Sales fell 11.3% to $9.77 billion, amid lower local prices due to a decline in energy prices, but topped expectations of $9.71 billion. Volume fell 2%, as growth in demand for food, health and hygiene packaging; surfactants and solvents for cleaning; and coatings was more than offset by declines in polyurethanes and silicones. Dow said it was beginning to see indications of recovery from COVID-19 in China. The company is further reducing its capital expenditure target to $1.25 billion, below the 2019 target of $2.0 billion, and trimming operating expenses by $350 million. The company is idling some manufacturing units.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose around 530 points, or 2.2%, at around 24,633, marking its highest level since March 10, the S&P 500 index  advanced 2.7%, at about 2,940, representing its highest close since March 6, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed up 3.6% at 8,915. All levels are on a preliminary basis. A benchmark of small-capitalization stocks, the Russell 2000 index  surged more than 5%, highlighting an area of the market that has made a powerful surge higher after being badly left behind during the coronavirus-induced rout in March, which hurt small businesses the most. Helping set the stage for gains on the day was a host of data from Gilead Sciences , which showed that its anti-malarial drug remdesivir was successful in treating certain patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the New York Times on Wednesday reported that the Food and Drug Administration is preparing to grant an emergency-use authorization as early as Wednesday. That news came after a series of data points from clinical trials were shared publicly, including promising results of a Gilead-sponsored trial, a positive preliminary data analysis from a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study, and data from a Chinese clinical trial published in The Lancet. Meanwhile, the Fed kept interest rates at a range of 0% and 0.25% but said that it intends on doing whatever is necessary to help support an economy and market beleaguered by the viral outbreak.    </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In a statement following its two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank said: \"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\" The Fed kept its benchmark rate close to a range of 0% and 0.25% and repeated it would hold policy steady until the economy has weathered recent events and \"is on track\" to achieve full employment and price stability. That is unchanged from the March forward guidance. The Fed has already reduced a key interest rate to near zero and increased its balance sheet to $6.6 trillion, adding $2.2 trillion over the course of the past few weeks, as it doled out funds to help prop up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic.

Gilead said an open-label Phase 3 trial testing the therapy in severely ill patients found that those taking a 5-day or 10-day course of treatment led to similar results. At least 52% of participants taking either dosing regimen were discharged from the hospital after 14 days of treatment, and at least 53% of those patients were reported as reaching \"clinical recovery.\" \"Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19,\" Gilead chief medical officer Merdad Parsey said in a statement. \"The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir.\" Minutes before this topline data was released, Gilead also said that a government-run clinical trial evaluating remdesivir in severely ill COVID-19 patients met the study's primary endpoint. That study is being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is expected to provide additional information about that trial, Gilead said.
