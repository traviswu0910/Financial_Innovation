The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 166 points, or 0.7%, at 24,049, the S&P 500 index  added 0.7% at 2,889, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  advanced 1% at 8,894.

Wall Street also was watching for updates on corporate results from the likes of Dow component Walt Disney & Co.  and others. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 300 points, or 1.3%, at 24,051, the S&P  500 index was up 1.4% at 2,880, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was rising 1.4% at 8,835. Gains on the morning were coming as West Texas Intermediate crude-oil prices  for June surged nearly 15% early Tuesday. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday said that clothing stores and a number of other retailers could open for curbside pickup on Friday, among a number of states that are slowly attempting to unwind measures put in place to limit the COVID-19 disease. Meanwhile, in economic news, the U.S. trade deficit widened by almost 12% in March as the coronavirus pandemic grounded international flights, froze the global tourism industry and caused massive disruptions in the exchange of goods such as new cars and iPhones. Investors also will hear from a number of Federal Reserve speakers, including Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans at 10 a.m., and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic at 2 p.m. In corporate news, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.  said Tuesday its NCL Corp. subsidiary is proposing to sell $650 million in exchangeable senior notes due 2024 in a private offering.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  were up 0.2%, at 23,805 those for the S&P 500 index  were rising 0.2% at 2,864.50, while Nasdaq-100 futures  gained 0.3% at 8,950.25. Stocks lost steam into the close of the regular session Tuesday, with the Dow  gaining 133.33 points, or 0.6%, to end at 24,883.09, the S&P 500 index  advancing 25.70 points to finish at 2,868.44, a gain of 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite index  adding 98.41 points, or 1.1%, to close at 8,809.12. The lose of momentum on Tuesday was attributed partly to comments from Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who said: \"We're living through the most severe contraction in activity and surge in unemployment that we've seen in our lifetimes,\" in an interview on CNBC, referring to the coronavirus-induced slowdowns. \"This is not a typical recession. It's going to be a very, very sharp contraction\" in the second quarter,\" he explained. The remarks appeared sufficient to knock some of the stuffing out of an equity market that had been enjoying a sharp broad-based rally. However, the Fed's No. 2 did note that the \"recovery could begin in the second half\" of 2020. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, speaking Tuesday evening at a Honeywell International Inc., where N95 masks and other personal protective equipment was being manufactured in Arizona, acknowledged reports that his administration may be phasing out the coronavirus task force. During an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence said \"as states are reopening, we're seeing progress that we're making. Markets had been rising on easing of lockdown protocols in a number of U.S. states. However, worries about China-U.S. tensions, centered on Beijing's handling of the viral outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan in December, and lingering concerns about how adeptly companies will be able to adapt to the new era of COVID-19, combined to inject some uncertainty in equity markets. In corporate news, shares of entertainment giant Walt Disney & Co.  were down 2.3% in after-hours trade following the company's quarterly report showed that its profit dove  more than 90% in the second quarter, with more than $1 billion in lost profit from its theme parks alone, which have been mostly shuttered due to the deadly infectious disease. Meanwhile, alternative-meat maker Beyond Meat Inc.  saw its shares surge more than 10% after the regular session Tuesday after it reported first-quarter net income of $1.8 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of $6.6 million, or 95 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue grew 141% to $97.1 million from $40.2 million in the year-ago period. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Excluding special items, adjusted EPS fell to 59 cents from 98 cents but matched the FactSet consensus. Sales fell 11.3% to $9.77 billion, amid lower local prices due to a decline in energy prices, but topped expectations of $9.71 billion. Volume fell 2%, as growth in demand for food, health and hygiene packaging; surfactants and solvents for cleaning; and coatings was more than offset by declines in polyurethanes and silicones. Dow said it was beginning to see indications of recovery from COVID-19 in China. The company is further reducing its capital expenditure target to $1.25 billion, below the 2019 target of $2.0 billion, and trimming operating expenses by $350 million. The company is idling some manufacturing units.

Meanwhile, June West Texas Intermediate crude , which closed 3% lower Tuesday, jumped around 15% in electronic trading Tuesday night, to just above $14 a barrel. U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday, squandering early gains, as tech stocks took a hit ahead of earnings reports. Wednesday is one of the busiest days of earnings seasons, with Facebook, Tesla and Boeing, among others, reporting. Investors are also looking forward to comments Wednesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak as the Fed wraps up two days of meetings. While no major moves by the Fed are expected, Powell is expected to give a message that the central bank has the current crisis under control.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 522 points, or 2.2%, at 24,620, the S&P 500 index  rose 2.6% at 2,937, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  climbed 3.4% at 8,895. In a statement following its two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank said: \"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\" The Fed kept its benchmark rate close to a range of 0% and 0.25% and repeated it would hold policy steady until the economy has weathered recent events and \"is on track\" to achieve full employment and price stability. That is unchanged from the March forward guidance. The Fed has already reduced a key interest rate to near zero and increased its balance sheet to $6.6 trillion, adding $2.2 trillion over the course of the past few weeks, as it doled out funds to help prop up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic. A news conference hosted by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be held at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose around 530 points, or 2.2%, at around 24,633, marking its highest level since March 10, the S&P 500 index  advanced 2.7%, at about 2,940, representing its highest close since March 6, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed up 3.6% at 8,915. All levels are on a preliminary basis. A benchmark of small-capitalization stocks, the Russell 2000 index  surged more than 5%, highlighting an area of the market that has made a powerful surge higher after being badly left behind during the coronavirus-induced rout in March, which hurt small businesses the most. Helping set the stage for gains on the day was a host of data from Gilead Sciences , which showed that its anti-malarial drug remdesivir was successful in treating certain patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the New York Times on Wednesday reported that the Food and Drug Administration is preparing to grant an emergency-use authorization as early as Wednesday. That news came after a series of data points from clinical trials were shared publicly, including promising results of a Gilead-sponsored trial, a positive preliminary data analysis from a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study, and data from a Chinese clinical trial published in The Lancet. Meanwhile, the Fed kept interest rates at a range of 0% and 0.25% but said that it intends on doing whatever is necessary to help support an economy and market beleaguered by the viral outbreak.    </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Remdesivir is widely considered to be a front-runner among the investigational therapies being tested as treatments for infections caused by the novel coronavirus.

A clinical trial on the Gilead Sciences's  drug remdesivir had been viewed by the World Health Organization and accidentally published, the FT reported. The FT said that researchers studied 237 patients, giving the drug to 158 and comparing their progress with the remaining 79. The story indicated that the drug showed significant side effects in some, with 18 patients taken off it. A WHO spokesperson told Stat that the manuscript is undergoing peer review and was published by accident. Earlier this month Chinese authorities had halted two trials for remdesivir, saying that there weren't enough patients to fully enroll the studies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was bouncing around in afternoon action, well of its highs, and was trading up 123 points, or 0.5%, at 23,589, the S&P 500 index  was up 0.5% at 2,812, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 0.6% at 8,551. Meanwhile, shares of Gilead were down nearly 4% Thursday. A report last week from Stat News indicated that remdesivir was seeing some success but the research linked to that report was not based on a clinical study.  A Gilead spokesperson was quoted as saying in Stat that reports of the research \"included inappropriate characterization of the study.\"  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
