The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Revenue for the iPhone category fell by 6.7% in the March quarter and revenue for the wearables segment increased 22.5%. Apple also anticipates that year-over-year revenue performance will improve in the June quarter for Macs and iPads as more people work and study remotely. Mac revenue dropped 2.9% from a year earlier in the March quarter while iPad revenue fell 10.3%. Maestri said that Apple was seeing \"two distinct trends\" in services and he expects \"very strong recent performance\" for the App Store, video, Apple Music, and cloud services to continue through the June period while services like AppleCare may remain pressured. Apple also expects a negative impact of $1.5 billion from foreign exchange in the current quarter. Apple shares were off 2.4% in after-hours trading Thursday after the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures  fell more than 280 points, or 1.2%, and S&P 500 futures  and Nasdaq-100 futures  declined as well. Apple  and Amazon  reported earnings after the market closed, with Apple reporting a dip in profits but growing sales, but the tech giant said it would not give third-quarter guidance due to uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Amazon beat analysts' earnings estimates, but warned it might lose money in the current quarter as it ramps up spending to deal with the pandemic. Both companies' stock fell in the extended session. Earlier in the day, U.S. stocks ended lower as investors weighed mixed corporate earnings and a report that the Trump administration was considering retaliating against China for its handling of the coronavirus. Still, for the month, the Dow  gained 11.1%, while the S&P 500  ended up 12.7%, representing their best monthly gains since 1987 and their best April performances since 1938, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq  ended up 15.5%, its best monthly advance since 2000 and its best April on record.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Net income totaled $83 million, or 27 cents per share, down from $262 million, or 83 cents per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of 64 cents missed the FactSet consensus of 67 cents. Yum paid an after-tax impairment charge of $107 million associated with the acquisition of The Habit Restaurants Inc. and the spread of the coronavirus, resulting in a special item totaling about 35 cents per share. Revenue of $1.26 billion was up slightly from $1.25 billion last year and ahead of the FactSet outlook for $1.22 billion. Same-stores sales fell 7% versus the FactSet consensus for a 6.8% decline. KFC was down 8%, Pizza Hut was down 11% and Taco Bell same-store sales rose 1%. David Gibbs, Yum Brands chief executive, said the company's locations largely remained open despite the spread of the coronavirus. Yum borrowed $525 million under its revolving facility on March 24 for financial flexibility and $425 million on March 18 to acquire Habit Restaurants. Yum stock is down 15% for the past year while the S&P 500 index  has fallen 2.7% for the period.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The drugmaker's stock was halted in premarket trading on Wednesday in advance of company disclosures about remdesivir's performance in the studies. Gilead said an open-label Phase 3 trial testing the therapy in severely ill patients found that those taking a 5-day or 10-day course of treatment led to similar results. At least 52% of participants taking either dosing regimen were discharged from the hospital after 14 days of treatment, and at least 53% of those patients were reported as reaching \"clinical recovery.\" \"Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19,\" Gilead chief medical officer Merdad Parsey said in a statement. \"The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir.\" Minutes before this topline data was released, Gilead also said that a government-run clinical trial evaluating remdesivir in severely ill COVID-19 patients met the study's primary endpoint. That study is being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is expected to provide additional information about that trial, Gilead said. Gilead's stock has gained 21.0% year-to-date, while the S&P 500  is down 11.3%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Trump, during a Tuesday evening news briefing centered on the country's response to the coronavirus epidemic, said that he would aim to ban immigration for a 60-day period, citing a need to focus on \"American workers\" after the pandemic hurt business activity. In regular trade Tuesday, the Dow  fell 631.56 points, or 2.7%, at 23,018, the S&P 500 index  lost 86.60 points, or 3.1%, to close at 2,736.56, with both benchmarks finishing at their lowest levels since April 7, according to FactSet data. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index  retreated 297.50 points, or 3.5%, to end at 8,263.23, marking the lowest close since April 13.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
