["FED", {"title": "Warren Buffett says Fed's Jerome Powell belongs on same 'pedestal' as Paul Volcker", "link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/marketpulse/~3/AQTp0D0OHIo/story.aspx", "description": "<p>Berkshire Hathaway   Chairman and Chief Executive Warren Buffett on Saturday had high praise for the Federal Reserve's handling of the market turmoil that accompanied the deepening of the coronavirus crisis in March, comparing Chairman Jerome Powell with the late Paul Volcker, who was credited with taming runaway inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \"He and Jay Powell couldn't seem more different in temperament..but Jay Powell, in my view, and the Fed board belong up there on the pedestal\" with him, Buffett said in remarks at Berkshire's annual meeting, being held online this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Buffett said the Fed's muscular response to a Treasury market that had nearly frozen and other financial turmoil in March was crucial to averting deeper carnage. Conditions were sparking fear and \"fear is the most contagious disease you can imagine,\" Buffett said, with conditions approaching a \"total freeze\" in credit markets before the Fed took action. Every company that issued bonds in late March and April should write a thank-you letter to the Fed, he said, because the issuance couldn't have taken place if the central bank hadn't acted with \"unprecedented speed and determination.\" While nobody knows exactly what the consequences will be of the Fed's massive expansion of its balance sheet, \"we do know the consequences of doing nothing and that's would have been the tendency of the Fed in many years past.\" Buffett said such incidents illustrated why Berkshire Hathaway carries a large chunk of cash, including a hefty chunk of Treasury bills. While it doesn't necessarily need a pile as large as what's now on the books, it does want to be prepared for a scenario where there isn't a Fed that acts as aggressively and, any case, doesn't want to depend not only on the \"kindness of strangers but on the kindness of friends.\"</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

progress on treatment for the novel strain of coronavirus and the Federal Reserve pledged to use its policy tools to help limit the economic damage from business shutdowns intended to slow down the spread of the contagion. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose around 530 points, or 2.2%, at around 24,633, marking its highest level since March 10, the S&P 500 index  advanced 2.7%, at about 2,940, representing its highest close since March 6, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed up 3.6% at 8,915. All levels are on a preliminary basis. A benchmark of small-capitalization stocks, the Russell 2000 index  surged more than 5%, highlighting an area of the market that has made a powerful surge higher after being badly left behind during the coronavirus-induced rout in March, which hurt small businesses the most. Helping set the stage for gains on the day was a host of data from Gilead Sciences , which showed that its anti-malarial drug remdesivir was successful in treating certain patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the New York Times on Wednesday reported that the Food and Drug Administration is preparing to grant an emergency-use authorization as early as Wednesday. That news came after a series of data points from clinical trials were shared publicly, including promising results of a Gilead-sponsored trial, a positive preliminary data analysis from a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study, and data from a Chinese clinical trial published in The Lancet. Meanwhile, the Fed kept interest rates at a range of 0% and 0.25% but said that it intends on doing whatever is necessary to help support an economy and market beleaguered by the viral outbreak.    </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Most recently the measure of unemployment was near a historic low at 3.5% in February but since then more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs, weekly data show. Labor-market reports for March indicated 701,000 job losses and an unemployment rate at 4.4%. It's likely to show much worse numbers for April. That said, Powell says \"we will see social-distancing restrictions rolled back\" but added that it will take time for a sense of normalcy to return. The Labor Department will report nonfarm payrolls May 8, which will provide the most up-to-date unemployment in the U.S. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
