The payments company reported net income of $104 million, or 48 cents a share, down from $120 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.58 from $1.34, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had been modeling $1.53. Revenue for Global Payments rose to $1.91 billion from $883 million a year period, while analysts were expecting $1.89 billion. The current results include revenue from Total System Services, which Global Payments acquired in September 2019. \"In the first quarter, our focus on execution enabled us to meaningfully expand operating margins and grow adjusted earnings per share in the high teens despite the impact of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of scale in payments,\" Chief Executive Jeff Sloan said in a release. The company has begun cost-savings initiatives that are expected to drive at least $400 million in expense savings over the next year. Global Payments shares have lost 17% over the past three months as the S&P 500  has declined 14%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company reported first-quarter net income of $505 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $447 million, or 58 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for items such as stock-based compensation, among other things, earnings were 76 cents a share. Revenue fell to $1.79 billion from $1.83 billion in the year-ago period; Activision reported net bookings rose to $1.52 billion compared with $1.26 billion a year ago. Bookings is a common non-GAAP financial measure used by videogame companies to capture revenue from digital and physical sales. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share on net bookings of $1.32 billion. The videogame maker said it saw better-than-expected results for its key franchises as populations sheltering at home turned to its various titles for entertainment and social connection. Activision said it expects full-year earnings of $2.22 a share on sales of $6.8 billion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said its staff had moved to work from home in mid-March. The company said that while working remotely brings challenges, it has implemented measures to address those areas, and based on what it has accomplished so far \"we expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year.\" Activision stock has gained 45% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index  fell 3.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index fund  lost 1.3%, the Invesco NASDAQ Internet ETF  was down 1.6%, and the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF  fell 0.9%. All three have strong exposures to so-called \"FANG\" stocks: Facebook Inc. , Amazon.com Inc. , Netflix Inc. , and Google/Alphabet  [s:GOOGL], ranging from 28% for FDN to 35% for PNQI, the funds' ticker symbols. Tech stocks have bounced back by the most since the March 23 lows for the broader market as investors bet the post-coronavirus world will depend more on technological innovations than before. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was under pressure in Tuesday trade,  seeing the sharpest decline for the session, even as the small-cap Russell 2000  held on to gains.
