Trading volume swelled to 30.8 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 1.7 million shares. Elexion's stock fell 4.4% in morning trading. Under terms of the deal, Alexion will launch a tender offer to buy Portola shares at $18 each in cash, which is 132% above Monday's closing price of $7.76. With about 78.08 million shares outstanding, that offer price implies a market capitalization of $1.41 billion. As part of the deal, Alexion will be acquiring $215 million of cash on Portola's balance sheet, net of debt. Alexion said it will fund the deal with cash on hand. Portola's stock has still lot 25.4% year to date, while Alexion shares have slipped 8.1% and the S&P 500  has declined 10.9%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
