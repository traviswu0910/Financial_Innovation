Passengers will be required to bring their own masks, the company said in a release, though it will have some additional supplies for those who forget. Alaska Airlines said it would also be conducting \"expanded enhanced cleaning\" of high-touch surfaces like tray tables and seat belts, using \"high-grade, EPA registered disinfectants.\" The airline is also expanding its use of \"electrostatic sanitizing spray\" for aircraft interiors. It will be blocking out middle seats on large aircraft and aisle seats on small aircraft through May 31. Alaska Air shares are down more than 4% in premarket trading Friday. They've lost 52% so far this year as the S&P 500  has declined about 10%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Late Thursday, Amazon said coronavirus-related costs such as employee testing and higher wages added to expenses and would likely in the future. Meanwhile, Apple declined to provide guidance for the current quarter. Adding to the bearish tone, President Trump indicated he may consider imposing tariffs on China, for their role in handling the novel coronavirus outbreak, which was first identified in Wuhan, China.

Excluding special items, adjusted EPS fell to 59 cents from 98 cents but matched the FactSet consensus. Sales fell 11.3% to $9.77 billion, amid lower local prices due to a decline in energy prices, but topped expectations of $9.71 billion. Volume fell 2%, as growth in demand for food, health and hygiene packaging; surfactants and solvents for cleaning; and coatings was more than offset by declines in polyurethanes and silicones. Dow said it was beginning to see indications of recovery from COVID-19 in China. The company is further reducing its capital expenditure target to $1.25 billion, below the 2019 target of $2.0 billion, and trimming operating expenses by $350 million. The company is idling some manufacturing units.

U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday, squandering early gains, as tech stocks took a hit ahead of earnings reports. Wednesday is one of the busiest days of earnings seasons, with Facebook, Tesla and Boeing, among others, reporting. Investors are also looking forward to comments Wednesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak as the Fed wraps up two days of meetings.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose around 530 points, or 2.2%, at around 24,633, marking its highest level since March 10, the S&P 500 index  advanced 2.7%, at about 2,940, representing its highest close since March 6, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed up 3.6% at 8,915. All levels are on a preliminary basis. A benchmark of small-capitalization stocks, the Russell 2000 index  surged more than 5%, highlighting an area of the market that has made a powerful surge higher after being badly left behind during the coronavirus-induced rout in March, which hurt small businesses the most. Helping set the stage for gains on the day was a host of data from Gilead Sciences , which showed that its anti-malarial drug remdesivir was successful in treating certain patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the New York Times on Wednesday reported that the Food and Drug Administration is preparing to grant an emergency-use authorization as early as Wednesday. That news came after a series of data points from clinical trials were shared publicly, including promising results of a Gilead-sponsored trial, a positive preliminary data analysis from a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study, and data from a Chinese clinical trial published in The Lancet. Meanwhile, the Fed kept interest rates at a range of 0% and 0.25% but said that it intends on doing whatever is necessary to help support an economy and market beleaguered by the viral outbreak.    </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In a statement following its two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank said: \"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\" The Fed kept its benchmark rate close to a range of 0% and 0.25% and repeated it would hold policy steady until the economy has weathered recent events and \"is on track\" to achieve full employment and price stability. That is unchanged from the March forward guidance. The Fed has already reduced a key interest rate to near zero and increased its balance sheet to $6.6 trillion, adding $2.2 trillion over the course of the past few weeks, as it doled out funds to help prop up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic.

The company earlier this month announced the resumption of its operations in the Seattle area. Similarly to what it has vowed to do in Washington state, Boeing said it will have signage to keep social distancing and cleanliness requirements, it will encourage face coverings, and voluntary temperature screening at the South Carolina facilities. Boeing is slated to report first-quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday, with investors eyeing coronavirus-related updates and the latest on the effort to return its grounded 737 Max aircraft to service.

A clinical trial on the Gilead Sciences's  drug remdesivir had been viewed by the World Health Organization and accidentally published, the FT reported. The FT said that researchers studied 237 patients, giving the drug to 158 and comparing their progress with the remaining 79. The story indicated that the drug showed significant side effects in some, with 18 patients taken off it. A WHO spokesperson told Stat that the manuscript is undergoing peer review and was published by accident. Earlier this month Chinese authorities had halted two trials for remdesivir, saying that there weren't enough patients to fully enroll the studies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was bouncing around in afternoon action, well of its highs, and was trading up 123 points, or 0.5%, at 23,589, the S&P 500 index  was up 0.5% at 2,812, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 0.6% at 8,551. Meanwhile, shares of Gilead were down nearly 4% Thursday.

After the regular session the U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved a nearly $500 billion aid package for small businesses and hospitals hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, setting up a vote in the House of Representatives as President Donald Trump threw his support behind the measure. Trump, during a Tuesday evening news briefing centered on the country's response to the coronavirus epidemic, said that he would aim to ban immigration for a 60-day period, citing a need to focus on \"American workers\" after the pandemic hurt business activity. In regular trade Tuesday, the Dow  fell 631.56 points, or 2.7%, at 23,018, the S&P 500 index  lost 86.60 points, or 3.1%, to close at 2,736.56, with both benchmarks finishing at their lowest levels since April 7, according to FactSet data. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index  retreated 297.50 points, or 3.5%, to end at 8,263.23, marking the lowest close since April 13.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
