Sales fell to $2.725 billion from $2.769 billion, but were also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $2.680 billion. The company said it had liquidity of $1.7 billion at quarter end, its highest net cash position in two years. \"Our B2B focus is helping businesses remain operational in the home or at the office, our facilities have largely remained open serving customers with enhanced sanitation and safety protocols, and our eCommerce platform and retail stores are proving to be trusted means for customers to access the critical products and services they need,\" Chief Executive Gerry Smith said in a statement. Same-store sales rose 2% in the quarter and e-commerce sales saw a strong jump in demand, he said. The company is withdrawing its 2020 guidance given the uncertainty around the pandemic and is suspending temporarily its share buybacks and dividend payments. Separately, it announced that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, to block any party from taking advantage of a falling share price to build a stake in the company.

The payments company reported net income of $104 million, or 48 cents a share, down from $120 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.58 from $1.34, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had been modeling $1.53. Revenue for Global Payments rose to $1.91 billion from $883 million a year period, while analysts were expecting $1.89 billion. The current results include revenue from Total System Services, which Global Payments acquired in September 2019. \"In the first quarter, our focus on execution enabled us to meaningfully expand operating margins and grow adjusted earnings per share in the high teens despite the impact of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of scale in payments,\" Chief Executive Jeff Sloan said in a release. The company has begun cost-savings initiatives that are expected to drive at least $400 million in expense savings over the next year. Global Payments shares have lost 17% over the past three months as the S&P 500  has declined 14%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

"http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/marketpulse/~3/3KoP5nlbNnM/story.aspx", "description": "<p>Shares of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp.  rose 1.9% in morning trading Wednesday, after the vacation ownership and property management company provided a first-quarter profit outlook that was well above expectations, but said it was furloughing most of its staff, closing all sales centers through May and suspending its dividend in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company said contract sales were up 10% from a year ago for the quarter to March 13, but given the impact of the pandemic since then, contract sales for the full quarter are expected to be down 13%. The company expects to report a net loss of $39 million to $114 million, including an impairment charge of $20 million to $100 million. Excluding non-recurring items, the company expects an adjusted profit of $2.15 a share, above the FactSet consensus of $1.27. The actions the company is taking to reduce its cash spend in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic include furloughing nearly 65% of its staff, cutting executive salaries by 50%, reducing work weeks by 25%, deferring 401(k) matches and suspending dividend payments and stock repurchases. The company last quarterly dividend of 54 cents a share was paid in February, which at current stock prices implies a dividend yield of 2.75%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500  of 2.02%. Marriott Vacations' stock has plunged 74.0% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 has declined 13.9%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting an adjusted net loss of 19 cents a share. Revenue rose to $470 million from $320.5 million, while analysts had been modeling $443.2 million. \"While the COVID-19 pandemic has subdued commerce globally and especially strained small and medium-sized businesses, it has accelerated the shift of purchase habits to ecommerce,\" Shopify said in a release. The company said it is \"uniquely positioned to help businesses of all sizes during this time\" and rolled out new initiatives recently including a 90-day free trial for new subscribers its standard plan as well as curbside pickup and delivery options. \"Shopify's strong Q1 results reinforce our positive view of the company's growth strategy, the more important role of e-commerce technology and services in the current environment, and Shopify's ability to adapt quickly as a reflection of strong product and engineering capabilities,\" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote.

The company swung to a net loss of $184 million, or $1.46 a share, from net income of $45 million, or 26 cents a share, in the year-ago period amid mark-to-market losses on oilseed crushing contracts and forward hedges related to its oil pipeline.

Sales fell to $9.17 billion from $9.94 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for a rise to $10.19 billion. \"Our underlying business performed well during the quarter, and the mark-to-market adjustments we incurred are expected to reverse in the coming quarters,\" said Chief Executive Greg Heckman.
