disruptions: Stifel", "link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/marketpulse/~3/hg6jEb4YoBU/story.aspx", "description": "<p>Stifel analysts analyzed a random sampling of Wendy's Co.  menus and found that 5% to 10% presented a chicken-only menu. \"While we believe this is a transient issue, we expect impacts to the system's beef supply will be a flash point during the earnings call and further interruptions could lead to share price volatility in the near-term,\" analysts led by Chris O'Cull wrote in a report. There have been concerns about meat shortages nationwide, with reports that Costco Wholesale Corp.  is limiting the amount of meat customers can purchase and Kroger Co.  putting limits on the amount of pork and ground beef shoppers can buy at select stores. Meat plants, including some run by Tyson Foods Inc. , have had to shut temporarily due to COVID-19. President Trump issued an executive order for plants to remain open. \"Unlike other major burger chains, Wendy's uses \"fresh, never frozen\" beef, which we believe gives it outsized exposure to recent disruptions,\" Stifel said, noting that it could be an issue when Wendy's reports first-quarter earnings, which is scheduled for tomorrow before the opening bell. Still, analysts are bullish, rating Wendy's stock buy with a $22 price target. \"We continue to believe the company is well-positioned to grow the breakfast day-part as states begin to ease restrictions, providing a structural same-restaurant sales tailwind and expect the current environment has only accelerated the growth of its digital platform,\" the report said. MarketWatch has reached out to Wendy's for comment. Wendy's stock slumped 2.8% on Tuesday, but has climbed 1.6% over the last year. The S&P 500 index  is down 2% for the past 12 months.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

A preprint is a type of preliminary report that has not been peer-reviewed and is not considered factual. The D614 mutation, which may be replacing the original Wuhan version of the virus, may also heighten the risk of a second infection and may be associated with higher rates of transmissibility. \"Increased infectivity would be consistent with rapid spread,\" the researchers wrote. In the early weeks of the pandemic, the D614 mutation was the most common form of the virus, with exceptions in Italy and Switzerland; however, throughout March, a form of the virus with the G614 mutation began to dominate. The mutations followed a similar path in the U.S., Canada, and some other countries, starting with the D614 form and then a rapid rise of the G614 mutation, which carries a higher viral load in patients. \"The D614 form was the dominant local form early in the epidemic. Wherever G614 entered a population, a rapid rise in its frequency followed, and in many cases G614 became the dominant local form in a matter of only a few weeks,\" they wrote. The researchers also said it's unclear why the D614 version of the virus is replacing the original virus. \"We do not know what is driving this selective sweep,\" they concluded.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The tests identify COVID-19 antibodies, which indicate a past infection with the novel coronavirus and are believed to provide some level of immunity to future infections; some experts say that widespread antibody testing is needed to reopen the economy. The FDA had announced on March 16 that antibody tests could be performed in some labs without an emergency use authorization (EUA), which is a type of regulatory OK granted during the pandemic. It is not an FDA approval. The makers of more than 200 tests have sought an EUA, and at least 12 have been granted one, including Abbott Laboratories Inc.  and Roche Holding AG . But concerns about the quality and marketing claims for some tests that have not received an EUA created concern at the FDA. \"The careful balancing of risks and benefits has shifted from where it was in mid-March,\" the regulator said. Test developers must now submit an EUA request with validation data within 10 days of an FDA notification, and these developers will follow a different submission template than the labs that are also developing antibody tests for authorization. \"Flexibility never meant we would allow fraud,\" the FDA said Monday. \"We, unfortunately, see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans' anxiety.\" This includes claiming the tests are FDA approved or authorized, that they can be conducted at home, or can be used to diagnose COVID-19, according to the FDA. The regulator noted that all forms of antibody tests can produce false results, based on their \"inherent limitations,\" and in some cases at least two antibody tests may need to be performed for one patient.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  were up 0.2%, at 23,805 those for the S&P 500 index  were rising 0.2% at 2,864.50, while Nasdaq-100 futures  gained 0.3% at 8,950.25. Stocks lost steam into the close of the regular session Tuesday, with the Dow  gaining 133.33 points, or 0.6%, to end at 24,883.09, the S&P 500 index  advancing 25.70 points to finish at 2,868.44, a gain of 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite index  adding 98.41 points, or 1.1%, to close at 8,809.12. The lose of momentum on Tuesday was attributed partly to comments from Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who said: \"We're living through the most severe contraction in activity and surge in unemployment that we've seen in our lifetimes,\" in an interview on CNBC, referring to the coronavirus-induced slowdowns. \"This is not a typical recession. It's going to be a very, very sharp contraction\" in the second quarter,\" he explained. The remarks appeared sufficient to knock some of the stuffing out of an equity market that had been enjoying a sharp broad-based rally. However, the Fed's No. 2 did note that the \"recovery could begin in the second half\" of 2020. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, speaking Tuesday evening at a Honeywell International Inc., where N95 masks and other personal protective equipment was being manufactured in Arizona, acknowledged reports that his administration may be phasing out the coronavirus task force.

but missed on revenue and provided a downbeat outlook, as the COVID-19 pandemic limited the ability to supply products to customers. The Apple Inc.  supplier said it swung to net income of $43.4 million, or 56 cents a share, from a loss of $74.3 million, or 98 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.26 from 92 cents, topping the FactSet consensus of $1.05. Revenue fell 7% to $402.8 million, missing the FactSet consensus of $408.5 million. \"As the outbreak spread outside of China late in the quarter, we experienced supply disruptions in excess of our prior assumptions,\" the company said in a statement. For the fourth quarter, the company expects adjusted EPS of 70 cents to 90 cents, below the FactSet consensus of $1.05, and revenue of $325 million to $365 million, below expectations of $411 million. The stock has lost 10.1% over the past three months through Monday, while the S&P 500  has shed 14.8%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Adjusted for items such as stock-based compensation, among other things, earnings were 76 cents a share. Revenue fell to $1.79 billion from $1.83 billion in the year-ago period; Activision reported net bookings rose to $1.52 billion compared with $1.26 billion a year ago. Bookings is a common non-GAAP financial measure used by videogame companies to capture revenue from digital and physical sales. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share on net bookings of $1.32 billion. The videogame maker said it saw better-than-expected results for its key franchises as populations sheltering at home turned to its various titles for entertainment and social connection. Activision said it expects full-year earnings of $2.22 a share on sales of $6.8 billion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said its staff had moved to work from home in mid-March. The company said that while working remotely brings challenges, it has implemented measures to address those areas, and based on what it has accomplished so far \"we expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year.\" Activision stock has gained 45% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index  fell 3.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
