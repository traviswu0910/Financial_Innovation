Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett defended corporate buybacks on Saturday, complaining that it has become \"very politically correct\" to oppose them. In response to a question at Berkshire's annual meeting, which is being held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Buffett repeated his defense of buybacks as a way for companies to return money to shareholders who want to cash out while giving remaining shareholders a larger stake in the company. While it is possible for companies to take a \"stupid\" approach to buybacks, there should be no taint to the practice when shares are priced below the company's intrinsic value, he said. Berkshire bought back $1.7 billion of its own shares in the first quarter, compared with $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, and some shareholders have pushed for a more aggressive buyback policy. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
