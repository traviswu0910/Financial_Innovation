Net income totaled $364 million, or $1 per share, down from $426 million, or $1.17 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of 77 cents missed the FactSet consensus for $1.04. Sales of $10.89 billion were down from $10.44 billion last year and below the FactSet outlook for $10.96 billion. Tyson's portfolio of brands includes the namesake, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. The company said it expects global demand for its meat and prepared foods to grow throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. \"Operationally, we have and expect to continue to face slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities from team member shortages or choices we make to ensure operational safety,\" the company said in the earnings release. \"The lower levels of productivity and higher costs of production we have experienced will likely continue in the short term until the effects of COVID-19 diminish.\" Last week, President Trump ordered meat plants to remain open, and spoke with Tyson Foods Chief Executive Noel White as well as other food industry leaders. Concerns have risen about a meat shortage due to plant closures from the coronavirus outbreaks. Tyson stock has tumbled 20.1% over the last year while the S&P 500 index  is down 3.9% for the period.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

J. Crew was taken private by private-equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners in 2010 for about $3 billion.
