The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Spirit had announced voluntary layoffs earlier this week. The employees affected on Friday are expected to leave the company on May 15, Spirit said. The company said it plans to lay off some more employees in other sites working in commercial aviation, and that defense work has not been affected. Spirit makes the 737 Max fuselage and other components, and both Airbus and Boeing have announced lower production rates for commercial aircraft due to the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation industry. \"In addition to reducing employment, we are taking other initiatives to lower costs and preserve liquidity, which included raising $1.2 billion in high yield secured second lien bonds in April,\" Chief Executive Tom Gentile said in a statement. Spirit said that some 700 employees are detailed to a temporary special project making medical devices, a task expected to last through October or longer. Spirit did not provide more details on the project, saying it will have more to share \"in the near future.\" Shares of Spirit rose 2% in the extended session Friday after ending the regular day down nearly 8%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

That has led states and local governments to compete for essential supplies, sending prices higher. The letter says the American Health Care Association is reporting that three quarters of its members are running out of PPE, including gowns and masks, and about 60% have started to make their own. Testing is another problem, and a key to keeping health professionals safe. \"More than two months into the pandemic crisis, my colleagues on the front lines still lack adequate PPE and cannot provide SARS-CoV-2 testing for many of their patients. Ensuring a steady and reliable pipeline for both PPE and for supplies needed to administer widespread testing is a vital prerequisite to safely reopening large swaths of the country,\" said Justin Lowenthal, co-chair of the COVID Response Taskforce & Member of the National Board of Directors, Doctors for America. \"Federal coordination is needed to ensure that our health care professionals can safely administer COVID-19 tests and effectively treat those who become sick.\" </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
