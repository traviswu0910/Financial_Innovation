Berkshire Hathaway Inc.   apparently saw its holdings of cash and equivalents balloon to a record $137.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from about $128 billion at year-end, suggesting that the legendary investor, viewed as a white knight of sorts on Wall Street, has stayed on the sidelines amid one of the most turbulent periods in financial markets in decades. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index  and the Nasdaq Composite  all tumbled into a bear-market in March, typically defined as a drop of at least 20% from a recent high, hit the lows of that rout on March 23. Since that point, however, stocks have climbed by more than 20% as the market attempted to recover from the effects of the worst pandemic in more than a 100 years--one that caused economies to fall into a recessionary state as businesses across the globe were forced to shut down to slow the spread of the deadly pathogen. Berkshire also has been hit by the epidemic that has infected more than 3.3 million people and claimed about 240,000 lives globally since the illness was first identified in December in Wuhan, China. The conglomerate reported a huge first quarter loss of $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per class A share. However, Berkshire's first-quarter operating earnings were $5.9 billion or about $3,619 per class A share. Buffett is scheduled to host a annual shareholder meeting later today at 4:45 p.m. Eastern Time, where he may offer more clues on his strategy during this public-health crisis. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Buffett said the Fed's muscular response to a Treasury market that had nearly frozen and other financial turmoil in March was crucial to averting deeper carnage. Conditions were sparking fear and \"fear is the most contagious disease you can imagine,\" Buffett said, with conditions approaching a \"total freeze\" in credit markets before the Fed took action. Every company that issued bonds in late March and April should write a thank-you letter to the Fed, he said, because the issuance couldn't have taken place if the central bank hadn't acted with \"unprecedented speed and determination.\" While nobody knows exactly what the consequences will be of the Fed's massive expansion of its balance sheet, \"we do know the consequences of doing nothing and that's would have been the tendency of the Fed in many years past.\" Buffett said such incidents illustrated why Berkshire Hathaway carries a large chunk of cash, including a hefty chunk of Treasury bills. While it doesn't necessarily need a pile as large as what's now on the books, it does want to be prepared for a scenario where there isn't a Fed that acts as aggressively and, any case, doesn't want to depend not only on the \"kindness of strangers but on the kindness of friends.\"</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
