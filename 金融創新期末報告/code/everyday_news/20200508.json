The maker of vehicle seats and electronic systems said net income dropped to $76.4 million, or $1.26 a share, from $228.9 million, or $3.73 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share fell to $2.05 from $4.00, but was above the FactSet consensus of $1.33. Revenue fell 13.6% to $4.46 billion, as COVID-19 shaved and estimated $900 million from revenue, but still beat the FactSet consensus of $4.22 billion. The company said it was not providing a full-year outlook given the significant uncertainty associated with the pandemic. \"Our first quarter financial results were significantly impacted by production disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Chief Executive Ray Scott. \"We experienced plant shutdowns in China beginning in late January that were followed by shutdowns of almost all our global operations outside of China beginning in mid- to late-March.\" The stock, which is still inactive in premarket trading, had dropped 23.8% over the  past three months, while the S&P 500  has lost 13.4%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

However, the market will have to overcome Friday's jobs report, which will underscore the depth of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the American economy. Thus far, the market has blown past Thursday's weekly jobless claims report, which showed that 3.2 million jobs were lost in April, bringing the total seeking jobless benefits in the U.S. over the past six weeks to 33 million, or approximately one out of every five eligible workers. Friday's nonfarm-payrolls report is expected to show that unemployment hit double-digits, with levels likely to exceed those of the 2008-09 financial crisis. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  were up 273 points, or 1.2% at 24,116, those for the S&P 500 index  gained 1.1% at 2,896.75, while Nasdaq-100 futures picked up 1.1% at 9,156. During Thursday's regular session, the Dow  ended 211.25 points, or 0.9%, higher, at 23,875.89, off its intraday high at 24,094.62, while the S&P 500  added 32.77 points, or 1.2%, to close at 2,881.19, led by a 2.5% rally in the energy sector [s:XX: SP500.10] and a 2.2% climb in financials [s:XX: SP500.40]. The Nasdaq Composite Index  wrapped up at 8,979.66, up 125.27 points, or 1.4%, notching a 0.08% year-to-date advance, erasing its losses for 2020. In corporate news, Dropbox Inc.  notched its first quarterly profit since its debut as a publicly traded company in 2018, and Uber Technologies  reported first-quarter results that revealed weakness in its ride-hailing business but a surge in its food-delivery segment.      </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
