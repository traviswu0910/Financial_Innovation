The move comes after state officials and the regulator found many imported N95 masks did not meet U.S. standards. In some cases, tests found 60% of 67 different kinds of imported masks allowed in more tiny particles in at least one sample than the U.S. standards allow. One Chinese company's masks filtered out only 24% to 35% of particles, below the 95% threshold that gives the masks their name. Today's move reverses a decision made on April 3 that approved all 80 manufacturers. Separately, the FDA said it has issued 42 warning letters to companies for making \"bogus COVID-19 claims\" including one to a seller of \"fraudulent chlorine dioxide products, equivalent to industrial bleach, frequently referred to as \"Miracle Mineral Solution\" or \"MMS\", as a treatment for COVID-19.\" The Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also been cracking down on false claims regarding products relating to the virus.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
