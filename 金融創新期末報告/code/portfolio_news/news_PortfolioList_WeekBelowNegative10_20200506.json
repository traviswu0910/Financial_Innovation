Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  were up 0.2%, at 23,805 those for the S&P 500 index  were rising 0.2% at 2,864.50, while Nasdaq-100 futures  gained 0.3% at 8,950.25. Stocks lost steam into the close of the regular session Tuesday, with the Dow  gaining 133.33 points, or 0.6%, to end at 24,883.09, the S&P 500 index  advancing 25.70 points to finish at 2,868.44, a gain of 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite index  adding 98.41 points, or 1.1%, to close at 8,809.12. The lose of momentum on Tuesday was attributed partly to comments from Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who said: \"We're living through the most severe contraction in activity and surge in unemployment that we've seen in our lifetimes,\" in an interview on CNBC, referring to the coronavirus-induced slowdowns. \"This is not a typical recession. It's going to be a very, very sharp contraction\" in the second quarter,\" he explained. The remarks appeared sufficient to knock some of the stuffing out of an equity market that had been enjoying a sharp broad-based rally. However, the Fed's No. 2 did note that the \"recovery could begin in the second half\" of 2020. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, speaking Tuesday evening at a Honeywell International Inc., where N95 masks and other personal protective equipment was being manufactured in Arizona, acknowledged reports that his administration may be phasing out the coronavirus task force. During an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence said \"as states are reopening, we're seeing progress that we're making. Markets had been rising on easing of lockdown protocols in a number of U.S. states. However, worries about China-U.S. tensions, centered on Beijing's handling of the viral outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan in December, and lingering concerns about how adeptly companies will be able to adapt to the new era of COVID-19, combined to inject some uncertainty in equity markets. In corporate news, shares of entertainment giant Walt Disney & Co.  were down 2.3% in after-hours trade following the company's quarterly report showed that its profit dove  more than 90% in the second quarter, with more than $1 billion in lost profit from its theme parks alone, which have been mostly shuttered due to the deadly infectious disease. Meanwhile, alternative-meat maker Beyond Meat Inc.  saw its shares surge more than 10% after the regular session Tuesday after it reported first-quarter net income of $1.8 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of $6.6 million, or 95 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue grew 141% to $97.1 million from $40.2 million in the year-ago period. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

levels, as market participants said cautious comments about the health of the U.S. economy from Federal Reserve's No. 2, Richard Clarida, deflated much stronger gains. Investors had been upbeat as the easing of social restrictions put in place to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic was fueling optimism on Wall Street. The S&P 500  rose 0.9% to 2,868. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 133 points, or 0.6%, to 23,883, all on a preliminary basis. The Nasdaq Composite  gained 1.1% to 8,809. Despite the pullback from the intrday high Tuesday stocks still have managed to shrug off the economic devastation across the U.S. as the reopening of some states and counties offers a glimpse of the recovery. In company news, shares of Hertz  tumbled more than 16% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the car rental company had hired an additional adviser to help with an imminent bankruptcy filing.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Late Thursday, Amazon said coronavirus-related costs such as employee testing and higher wages added to expenses and would likely in the future.

session after the Washington Post reported that U.S. officials were \"crafting retaliatory actions against China' as the Trump administration criticizes the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 288 points, or 1.2%, at 24,346, the S&P 500 index  ended off 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite Index  dropped 0.3%, with all the benchmarks closing well off their worst levels of the day. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December and Trump has recently railed against what he has described as the country's lack of transparency around the severity of the outbreak. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported the Trump officials have \"pushed American spy agencies to hunt for evidence to support\" an unsubstantiated theory that the novel strain of coronavirus was derived from a laboratory in Wuhan. The pandemic has infected more than 3 million people world-wide and claimed more than 230,000 lives, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

That news came after a series of data points from clinical trials were shared publicly, including promising results of a Gilead-sponsored trial, a positive preliminary data analysis from a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study, and data from a Chinese clinical trial published in The Lancet. Meanwhile, the Fed kept interest rates at a range of 0% and 0.25% but said that it intends on doing whatever is necessary to help support an economy and market beleaguered by the viral outbreak.    </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Gilead said an open-label Phase 3 trial testing the therapy in severely ill patients found that those taking a 5-day or 10-day course of treatment led to similar results.

Macy's Inc.  Chief Executive Jeff Gennette about moving forward with the department store's annual July 4 fireworks show. No decision has been made about what the fireworks show will look like just yet. \"But what we know for sure is this wonderful show will go on,\" Mayor de Blasio said. \"We will celebrate our nation's birthday. The city of New York will partner with Macy's to come up with something great no matter what the coronavirus throws at us.\" Mayor de Blasio has also promised a parade for first responders and health care workers when the city reopens. He previously announced that city permits for June events, including the Puerto Rican Day parade, have been canceled. MarketWatch has reached out to Macy's for comment. The struggling department store retailer is reportedly seeking to raise $5 billion to avoid bankruptcy. And Cowen analysts estimate the company has about four months of cash available. Macy's stock is down 7.4% in Wednesday trading, and have plummeted 80% over the past year. The S&P 500 index  has fallen 4.1% over the last 12 months.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company will ask all 2,800 workers to come to the plant for COVID-19 testing. \"The closure has significant ramifications beyond our company, since the plant is part of a larger supply chain that includes hundreds of independent farmers, truckers, distributors and customers, including grocers,\" Chief Executive Steve Stouffer said in a statement. \"It means the loss of a vital market outlet for farmers and further contributes to the disruption of the nation's pork supply.\" The company will pay workers while the plant is closed. The timing of a reopening depends on the outcome of testing, it said. The company's other meat and poultry plants remain open but are running at reduced levels of production.  Shares were slightly lower premarket, but are down 32% in the year to date, while the S&P 500  has fallen 15%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
