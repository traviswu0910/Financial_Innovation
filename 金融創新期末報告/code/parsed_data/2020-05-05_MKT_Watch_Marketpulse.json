The stock needs to end the day above its Feb. 19 closing price of $123.91. It recently changed hands at $126.69. PayPal is due to report March-quarter earnings after Wednesday's closing bell. UBS analyst Eric Wasserstrom wrote that recent reports from Visa Inc.  and Mastercard Inc.  were \"most positive for PayPal given its orientation to e-commerce.\" The credit-card giants pointed to online sales as a high point given disruptions to in-person spending. Shares of PayPal have gained 6% over the past three months as the S&P 500  has declined 13%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

There have been concerns about meat shortages nationwide, with reports that Costco Wholesale Corp.  is limiting the amount of meat customers can purchase and Kroger Co.  putting limits on the amount of pork and ground beef shoppers can buy at select stores. Meat plants, including some run by Tyson Foods Inc. , have had to shut temporarily due to COVID-19. President Trump issued an executive order for plants to remain open. \"Unlike other major burger chains, Wendy's uses \"fresh, never frozen\" beef, which we believe gives it outsized exposure to recent disruptions,\" Stifel said, noting that it could be an issue when Wendy's reports first-quarter earnings, which is scheduled for tomorrow before the opening bell. Still, analysts are bullish, rating Wendy's stock buy with a $22 price target. \"We continue to believe the company is well-positioned to grow the breakfast day-part as states begin to ease restrictions, providing a structural same-restaurant sales tailwind and expect the current environment has only accelerated the growth of its digital platform,\" the report said.

A preprint is a type of preliminary report that has not been peer-reviewed and is not considered factual. The D614 mutation, which may be replacing the original Wuhan version of the virus, may also heighten the risk of a second infection and may be associated with higher rates of transmissibility. \"Increased infectivity would be consistent with rapid spread,\" the researchers wrote. In the early weeks of the pandemic, the D614 mutation was the most common form of the virus, with exceptions in Italy and Switzerland; however, throughout March, a form of the virus with the G614 mutation began to dominate. The mutations followed a similar path in the U.S., Canada, and some other countries, starting with the D614 form and then a rapid rise of the G614 mutation, which carries a higher viral load in patients. \"The D614 form was the dominant local form early in the epidemic. Wherever G614 entered a population, a rapid rise in its frequency followed, and in many cases G614 became the dominant local form in a matter of only a few weeks,\" they wrote. The researchers also said it's unclear why the D614 version of the virus is replacing the original virus. \"We do not know what is driving this selective sweep,\" they concluded.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The tests identify COVID-19 antibodies, which indicate a past infection with the novel coronavirus and are believed to provide some level of immunity to future infections; some experts say that widespread antibody testing is needed to reopen the economy. The FDA had announced on March 16 that antibody tests could be performed in some labs without an emergency use authorization (EUA), which is a type of regulatory OK granted during the pandemic. It is not an FDA approval. The makers of more than 200 tests have sought an EUA, and at least 12 have been granted one, including Abbott Laboratories Inc.  and Roche Holding AG . But concerns about the quality and marketing claims for some tests that have not received an EUA created concern at the FDA. \"The careful balancing of risks and benefits has shifted from where it was in mid-March,\" the regulator said. Test developers must now submit an EUA request with validation data within 10 days of an FDA notification, and these developers will follow a different submission template than the labs that are also developing antibody tests for authorization. \"Flexibility never meant we would allow fraud,\" the FDA said Monday. \"We, unfortunately, see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans' anxiety.\" This includes claiming the tests are FDA approved or authorized, that they can be conducted at home, or can be used to diagnose COVID-19, according to the FDA. The regulator noted that all forms of antibody tests can produce false results, based on their \"inherent limitations,\" and in some cases at least two antibody tests may need to be performed for one patient.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
