Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average   were off 288 points, or 1.2%, at 23,331, those for the S&P 500 index   declined 31.45 points, or 1%, at 2,790.25, while Nasdaq-100 futures  retreated 88.25 points, or 1%, at 8,629.75. More than two dozen U.S. have begun to allow select businesses to open or announce plans to do in May, but local and federal officials are also facing climbing cases of novel cases of coronavirus, albeit, at a slower pace. The COVID-19 pandemic has killed nearly 250,000 people world-wide and infected 3.5 million, with 1.154 million in the U.S. alone, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, investors may pay close attention to the airline industry after Warren Buffett, during an annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, said that his Berkshire Hathaway   had sold all of its stake in major airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc. , Southwest Airlines , United Airlines-parent United Airlines Holdings Inc.  and American Airlines . On Friday, the Dow fell 622.03 points, or 2.6%, to end at 23,723.69, while the S&P 500 gave up 81.72 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 2,830.71.

Net income totaled $364 million, or $1 per share, down from $426 million, or $1.17 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of 77 cents missed the FactSet consensus for $1.04. Sales of $10.89 billion were down from $10.44 billion last year and below the FactSet outlook for $10.96 billion. Tyson's portfolio of brands includes the namesake, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. The company said it expects global demand for its meat and prepared foods to grow throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. \"Operationally, we have and expect to continue to face slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities from team member shortages or choices we make to ensure operational safety,\" the company said in the earnings release. \"The lower levels of productivity and higher costs of production we have experienced will likely continue in the short term until the effects of COVID-19 diminish.\" Last week, President Trump ordered meat plants to remain open, and spoke with Tyson Foods Chief Executive Noel White as well as other food industry leaders. Concerns have risen about a meat shortage due to plant closures from the coronavirus outbreaks. Tyson stock has tumbled 20.1% over the last year while the S&P 500 index  is down 3.9% for the period.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
